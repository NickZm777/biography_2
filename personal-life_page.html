            <p>In 1982, Chan married Joan Lin, a Taiwanese actress. Their son, singer and actor Jaycee Chan, was born that same year.[56] After he engaged 
                in an extra-marital affair with Elaine Ng Yi-Lei, an illegitimate daughter by the name of Etta Ng Chok Lam was born on 18 January 1999. 
                It turned into a scandal within the media. Although he reportedly gave Elaine 70,000 HK dollars each month for her living expenses and 
                600,000 HK dollars when she moved to Shanghai, the transactions were later claimed to be nonexistent by her lawyer. Despite regretting 
                the results of the affair, Chan said he had "only committed a fault that many men in the world commit". During the incident, 
                Elaine stated she would take care of her daughter without Chan.</p>
            <p>Chan received his honorary Doctor of Social Science degree in 1996 from the Hong Kong Baptist University. In 2009, he received another 
                honorary doctorate from the University of Cambodia,and has also been awarded an honorary professorship by the Savannah College of 
                Art and Design in Hong Kong in 2008. Chan is currently a faculty member of the School of Hotel and Tourism Management at the Hong Kong Polytechnic 
                University, where he teaches the subject of tourism management. As of 2015, he also serves as the Dean of the Jackie Chan Film and Television
                Academy under the Wuhan Institute of Design and Sciences</p>
            <p>Chan voiced the character of Shang in the Chinese release of the Walt Disney animated feature, Mulan (1998). He also performed the song "I'll 
                Make a Man Out of You", for the film's soundtrack. For the US release, the speaking voice was performed by B.D. Wong and the singing voice was 
                done by Donny Osmond. He also collaborated with Ani DiFranco on "Unforgettable"</p>
