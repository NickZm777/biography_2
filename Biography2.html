            <p>Chan Kong-sang, born 7 April 1954, known professionally as Jackie Chan, is a Hong Kong martial artist, 
                actor, film director, producer, stuntman, and singer. He is known in the cinematic world for his acrobatic 
                fighting style, comic timing, use of improvised weapons, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs 
                himself. He has trained in Wushu or Kung Fu and Hapkido, and has been acting since the 1960s, appearing in over 150 films.</p>
            <p>Chan is one of the most recognisable and influential cinematic personalities in the world, gaining a widespread following in both 
                the Eastern and Western hemispheres, and has received stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
                He has, and as of 2016, he was the second-highest paid actor in the world. 
                In the early 1990s, Chan broadened his cinematic range, turning in a rare dramatic performance in the melodramatic Crime Story (1993). 
                He also made several sequels to his hits Police Story and Drunken Master. Chan was still mostly in the United States by this 
                point, but his profile experienced a meteoric rise during the mid-1990s, of events to the attention of a wider American audience.</p>
            <p>Jackie Chan began studying martial arts, drama, acrobatics and singing at age seven. Once considered a likely successor to 
                Bruce Lee in Hong Kong cinema, Chan instead developed his own style of martial arts blended with screwball physical comedy. 
                He became a huge star throughout Asia and in the United States as well.  In 1986, he formed his own production 
                company, Golden Way. He also founded a modeling/casting agency, Jackie's Angels, in order to recruit talent for his films. 
                In the early 1990s, Chan broadened his cinematic range, turning in a rare dramatic performance in the melodramatic Crime Story (1993). 
                He also made several sequels to his hits Police Story and Drunken Master. Chan was still mostly unknown in the United States by this 
                point, but his profile experienced a meteoric rise during the mid-1990s, when a series of events combined to bring him to the 
                attention of a wider American audience.For his part, Chan claims to have broken every bone in his body at least once while performing 
                stunts. </p>
