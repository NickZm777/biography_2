            <p>Jackie Chan Action Movie Awards are awards presented to action film genre. The "Jackie Chan Action Movie Week" was originally presented during the 
                Shanghai International Film Festival since 2015, but in 2019 it moved to a new date and venue in Shanghai to become its own event. Voted by the 
                reporters in the entertainment industry, the awards are aimed at "celebrating international action movies and honoring those who have made outstanding 
                contributions to the genre". The award ceremony is named after Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan.
                Held in a full-sized sports arena, notable attendees at the inaugural solo event in 2019 included Chris Tucker, Adrien Brody and Paul Haggis. Variety 
                declared that the "scale (of the stunt-filled closing ceremony) suggested ambitions of matching an Olympic Games or World Cup ceremony.</p>
            <p>In the year 1980 and 1982, Chan’s first two directorial ventures were launched, ‘The Young Master’ and ‘Dragon Lord’. Both the movies did very well at 
                the Hong Kong box office and new innovations in comedy and martial arts stunts were introduced in the movies for the first time.
                ‘Armour of God’ in 1987 was a huge success at the box office that grossed over 35 million Hong Kong dollars. In 1998, ‘Rush Hour’ was a huge success 
                at the Hollywood box office, starring Chris Tucker along with him and it helped him to establish himself more properly in the west. Chan produced a number 
                of action comedy films with his opera school friends, Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao. The three co-starred together for the first time in 1983 in Project A, 
                which introduced a dangerous stunt-driven style of martial arts that won it the Best Action Design Award at the third annual Hong Kong Film Awards. 
                Over the following two years, the "Three Brothers" appeared in Wheels on Meals and the original Lucky Stars trilogy. In 1985, Chan made the first
                Police Story film, a crime action film in which Chan performed a number of dangerous stunts. It won Best Film at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards In 1986, 
                Chan played "Asian Hawk," an Indiana Jones-esque character, in the film Armour of God. The film was Chan's biggest domestic box office success up to that 
                point, grossing over HK$35 million.</p>
