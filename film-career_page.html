            <p>He began his career by appearing in small roles at the age of five as a child actor. At age eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "
                Little Fortunes" in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962) with Li Li-Hua playing his mother. The following year, the young actor 
                appeared in extras of The Love Eterne (1963) and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film Come Drink with Me. In 1971, after an appearance 
                as an extra in another kung fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan was signed to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company. At seventeen, he worked as a 
                stuntman in the Bruce Lee films Fist of Fury and Enter the Dragon under the stage name Chan Yuen Lung. He received his 
                first starring role later that year in Little Tiger of Canton that had a limited release in Hong Kong in 1973.</p>
            <p>Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under 
                a two-picture deal. Director Yuen Woo-ping allowed Chan complete freedom over his stunt work. The film established the comedic kung fu 
                genre, and proved refreshing to the Hong Kong audience. The same year, Chan then starred in Drunken Master, which finally propelled him 
                to mainstream success</p>
            <p>His films had collectively grossed HK$1.14 billion (US$147 million) at the Hong Kong box office up until 2010,[76] over US$72 million in South
                Korea between 1991 and 2010, and ¥48.4 billion (US$607 million) in Japan up until 2012. As of 2018, his films have grossed US$1.84 billion 
                (more than US$2.44 billion adjusted for inflation) in the United States and Canada, CN¥8.6 billion (US$1.3 billion) in China, 20 million 
                box office admissions in France, and over 27.3 million admissions in Germany, Spain and Italy. As of 2018, his films have grossed more 
                than US$5 billion at the worldwide box office</p>
