            <p>Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He has stated 
                in interviews that the primary inspiration for his more comedic stunts were films such as The General, directed by and starring Buster Keaton 
                who was also known to perform his own stunts. The team was established in 1983, and Chan has used them in all his subsequent films to make 
                choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities.[106] Chan and his team undertake many of the stunts performed by 
                other characters in his films, shooting the scenes so that their faces are obscured.</p>
            <p>Chan has been injured frequently when attempting stunts; many of them have been shown as outtakes or as bloopers during the closing credits of his films. 
                He came closest to death filming Armour of God when he fell from a tree and fractured his skull. Over the years, he has dislocated his pelvis and also 
                broken numerous parts of his body, including his fingers, toes, nose, both cheekbones, hips, sternum, neck, ankle, and ribs. Promotional 
                materials for Rumble in the Bronx emphasised that he performed all of the stunts, and one version of the movie poster even diagrammed his many injuries.</p>
            <p>In the 2000s, the ageing Chan grew tired of being typecast as an action hero, prompting him to act with more emotion in his latest films. In New Police Story, 
                he portrayed a character suffering from alcoholism and mourning his murdered colleagues. To further shed the image of a "nice guy", Chan played an 
                anti-hero for the first time in Rob-B-Hood starring as Thongs, a burglar with gambling problems. He plays a low-level gangster in 2009's Shinjuku 
                Incident, a serious drama set in Tokyo about unsavory characters.</p>
