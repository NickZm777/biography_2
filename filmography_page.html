            <p>Chan began his career as an extra child actor in the 1962 film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar. Ten years later, he was a stuntman opposite Bruce Lee in 1972's 
                Fist of Fury and 1973's Enter the Dragon. He then had starring roles in several kung fu films, such as 1973's Little Tiger of Canton and 1976's New Fist 
                of Fury. His first major breakthrough was the 1978 film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow, which was shot while he was loaned to Seasonal Film Corporation under 
                a two-picture deal. He then enjoyed greater success with similar kung fu comedy films such as 1978's Drunken Master and 1980's The Young Master.</p>
            <p>Jackie Chan's 100th movie,1911, which he co-directed, produced, and starred in, was released on September 26, 2011 and in North America on October 14. 
                While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this was his first directorial work since Who Am I? in 1998.
                While at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, Chan announced that he was retiring from action films citing that he was getting too old for the genre. He later 
                clarified that he would not be completely retiring from action films, but would be performing fewer stunts and taking care of his body more.
                Jackie Chan's first film in 2017 was Kung Fu. Jackie Chan plays the role as Jack, a world-renowned archaeology 
                professor. Jack and his team are on a grand quest to locate a lost ancient Indian treasure when they are ambushed by a team of mercenaries and left 
                for dead. Using his vast knowledge of Asian history, yoga and kung fu, Jack leads his team on a race around the world to beat the mercenaries to the 
                treasure and save an ancient culture in this breakneck action-comedy that reunites Chan with acclaimed director Stanley Tong.
                In Dragon Blade, a historical action film, Chan plays Huo An, the commander of the Protection Squad of the Western Regions during the Han Dynasty. 
                The film was released on February 19, 2015. His films had collectively grossed HK$1.14 billion  at the Hong Kong box office up until 
                2010, over US$72 million in South Korea between 1991 and 2010, and ¥48.4 billion in Japan up until 2012. As of 2018, his films have grossed US$1.84
