            <p>Chan was born on 7 April 1954 in Hong Kong as Chan Kong-sang to Charles and Lee-Lee Chan, refugees from the Chinese Civil War. 
                His parents nicknamed him Pao-pao (Chinese: 炮炮 'Cannonball') because the energetic child was always rolling around. His parents 
                worked for the French ambassador in Hong Kong, and Chan spent his formative years within the grounds of the consul's residence in 
                the Victoria Peak district.</p>
            <p>Chan attended the Nah-Hwa Primary School on Hong Kong Island, where he failed his first year, after which his parents withdrew him 
                from the school. In 1960, his father emigrated to Canberra, Australia, to work as the head cook for the American embassy, and Chan 
                was sent to the China Drama Academy, a Peking Opera School run by Master Yu Jim-yuen.[15][16] Chan trained rigorously for the next 
                decade, excelling in martial arts and acrobatics. He eventually became part of the Seven Little Fortunes, a performance group 
                made up of the school's best students, gaining the stage name Yuen Lo (元樓) in homage to his master. Chan became close friends with 
                fellow group members Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao, and the three of them later became known as the Three Brothers or Three Dragons.
                After entering the film industry, Chan along with Sammo Hung got the opportunity to train in hapkido under the grand master Jin Pal Kim, 
                and Chan eventually attained a black belt.[5] Jackie Chan also trained in other styles of martial arts such as Karate, Judo, Taekwondo 
                and Jeet Kune Do.</p>
            <p>JChan joined his parents in Canberra in 1976, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker.A fellow 
                builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, thus earning Chan the nickname of "Little Jack," later shortened to "Jackie", which has 
                stuck with him ever since.[20] In the late 1990s, Chan changed his Chinese name to Fong Si-lung (Chinese: 房仕龍), since his father's 
                original surname was Fong.</p>
